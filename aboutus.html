    <p id="introtext">We are the Robo Vikings #9990, a dedicated and passionate FIRST robotics team founded in 2015 by
        our teacher and
        mentor, Ray Alford. Since our inception, we have remained committed to the values of the FIRST Foundation,
        fostering STEM education and inspiring the next generation of engineers, innovators, and leaders.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout our journey, our alumni have gone on to pursue diverse and successful futures. Many have attended
        prestigious colleges such as NCSU and UNC Chapel Hill. Regardless of the path, the Robo Vikings alumni
        continue to make a significant impact in their respective fields.
        <br>
        <br>
        This year we focused on three main areas:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Since the previous season, our team has seen a shift, with a majority of our members being from the younger
        classes. This has motivated us to put an even stronger emphasis on training the next generation of Robo Vikings
        while continuing to fulfill our team's responsibilities.

        Thanks to our dedication and teamwork, we have qualified for the State Championship five times. We are
        incredibly grateful for the contributions and commitment of all past and present team members, as their hard
        work and passion have played a pivotal role in our success.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have worked hard to cultivate important skills that help us build and document the robot.
        <br>
        <br>
        Skills we have developed include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We continue to strive for excellence and remain committed to making a positive impact through robotics. Thank you to everyone who has been part of our journey!
