            We are the Robo Vikings #9990, a team founded in 2015 by our teacher and mentor, Ray Alford. Since then, we
            have
            remained dedicated to the FIRST Foundation and its mission. Over the years, our teams' alumni have gone
            on
            to attend top colleges like NCSU and UNC Chapel Hill, or have chosen alternative paths such as joining the
            military, ensuring bright futures in any path of their life.
        </p>

        <p id="introtext2">
            This year, we are focusing on three main goals, which include business partnerships, community outreach, and new member training. Since last season, our team has been reduced to mainly the younger classes, and this has made us more focused on training new members while also carrying out team duties. We routinely participate in outreach programs, which can be found at this page, <a href="outreach.html">OUTREACH.</a>
        </p>

        <p id="introtext3">
            Thanks to our team's hard work and determination, we have qualified for the State
            Championship five times. We are deeply grateful to all our past and present team members for their
            commitment to the Robo Vikings.
